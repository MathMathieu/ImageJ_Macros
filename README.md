# ImageJ_Macros
rushAnalysis macros can be used to analyze movies of RUSH transfected cells, to quantify the fluorescence in the Golgi and in large compartments ("withLysosomes" macro) and the number of positive small compartments.

Pearson_vs_time macro can be used to calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient between two channel over time for live imaging experiments.

Part1, Part2 and Part3 are three macros to be used sequencially for calculation of Mander's co-localization coefficient of a double positive cell compartment for two proteins with a third protein.
